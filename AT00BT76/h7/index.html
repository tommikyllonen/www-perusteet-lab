      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Tommi Kyllönen. My family consists of my wife and four children.
        After 20 years in production and engineering, I realized I wanted to become a software developer. At 39, I
        started studying my first vocational degree in IT, which took 2.5 years to complete. I worked for a while after
        that and, just six months ago, I began studying my first college degree in Information Technology at LAB
        University of Applied Sciences. Today, at 43, I’m proud to be building the career I truly love.
        I work as a software developer at Kempower in Lahti, where I design and build web applications for internal use
        across our three factories in Finland and one in the United States. Over the past 2 years, I’ve created many
        applications that streamline production processes, and I’m responsible for maintaining and improving our MES
        application using technologies like Svelte and TypeScript.
        Before returning to Finland 3 months ago, I spent two years in the United States working as a software
        developer. Outside of work and studies, I enjoy padel and golf, and I’m passionate about watches.
